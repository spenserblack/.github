# Contributing

Basic guidelines for contributing to my projects, according to my preferences.

## Making a pull request

Please try to keep a pull request as *small* as possible, while still being useful. This
helps make pull requests easier to review, and also helps get pull requests merged
faster. Some things to avoid when making a pull request are:

- Unrelated changes. Don't modify code that isn't relevant to what you're trying to do.
- Doing too many things. A very general rule is that, if you need to use the word "and"
  to describe your pull request, it should be split into two pull requests. *Don't* make
  a pull request like "add feature X and feature Y". Please note that this is a very
  general rule, and **sometimes it won't be reasonable to follow.** Use your best judgement
  to decide if it makes sense to split changes into multiple topics or not.

If you want to make a pull request that drastically changes the implementation, please
make sure that it's been discussed before you start coding. Nobody is happy when hours
of work are rejected.
